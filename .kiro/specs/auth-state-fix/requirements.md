# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical authentication state management issues causing page reloading and infinite re-renders in the React Native application. The current AuthContext implementation has flawed state management logic that triggers unnecessary re-renders and navigation loops, resulting in poor user experience during authentication flows.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user attempting to log in, I want the authentication process to complete without causing page reloads or infinite loading states, so that I can access the application smoothly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates login THEN the system SHALL prevent multiple simultaneous login attempts
2. WHEN authentication state changes THEN the system SHALL only trigger re-renders when actual state changes occur
3. WHEN login is in progress THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states without causing navigation loops
4. WHEN login completes successfully THEN the system SHALL navigate to the appropriate screen exactly once
5. WHEN login fails THEN the system SHALL display error messages without triggering page reloads

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the AuthContext to have proper state management, so that authentication flows are predictable and don't cause rendering issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AuthContext initializes THEN the system SHALL check authentication state exactly once
2. WHEN useEffect runs THEN the system SHALL have proper dependency arrays to prevent infinite loops
3. WHEN loading states change THEN the system SHALL combine isLoading and isSigningIn states appropriately
4. WHEN authentication state is accessed THEN the system SHALL provide consistent boolean values for isAuthenticated
5. IF multiple loading states exist THEN the system SHALL consolidate them into a single loading indicator

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user navigating the application, I want authentication state changes to trigger navigation only when necessary, so that I don't experience unexpected page reloads or navigation loops.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication state is checked THEN the system SHALL only navigate if the authentication status actually changed
2. WHEN the app initializes THEN the system SHALL check auth state without triggering unnecessary navigation
3. WHEN user logs out THEN the system SHALL navigate to login screen exactly once
4. WHEN user is already authenticated THEN the system SHALL not repeatedly redirect to dashboard
5. IF navigation logic responds to auth changes THEN the system SHALL debounce or guard against rapid successive navigation calls

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer debugging authentication issues, I want clear logging and state visibility, so that I can identify and resolve authentication flow problems quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication state changes THEN the system SHALL log relevant state transitions
2. WHEN errors occur during authentication THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
3. WHEN debugging is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide visibility into loading states and user status
4. WHEN state management issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear indicators of what triggered the change
5. IF authentication flows fail THEN the system SHALL provide actionable error messages for debugging
