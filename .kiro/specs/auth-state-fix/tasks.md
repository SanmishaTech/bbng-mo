# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Consolidate loading states in AuthContext

  - ✅ Added separate `isSigningIn` state to track login operations
  - ✅ Removed unused `isInitialized` state from interface
  - ✅ Updated AuthContextType interface to remove `isInitialized` property
  - ✅ Modified the context value object to combine `isLoading || isSigningIn` states
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 2. Implement operation locking for concurrent requests

  - ✅ Added guard in `signIn` method to prevent multiple simultaneous login attempts
  - ✅ Return appropriate error response when login is already in progress
  - ✅ Use `isSigningIn` state to track login operation status
  - ✅ Properly handle concurrent login attempt prevention
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2_

- [x] 3. Fix useEffect dependency management in AuthContext

  - ✅ Confirmed `checkAuthState` useEffect has proper empty dependency array
  - ✅ Removed unused `isInitialized` state management
  - ✅ Fixed loading state management to use separate states for different operations
  - ✅ Added proper error handling that doesn't interfere with state management
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2_

- [x] 4. Refactor navigation logic in \_layout.tsx

  - ✅ Existing `hasInitialized` state properly tracks when navigation logic should activate
  - ✅ Modified useEffect dependencies to remove 'user' dependency and prevent extra re-renders
  - ✅ Existing guards prevent navigation when auth state hasn't actually changed
  - ✅ Proper initial route handling that only runs once is already implemented
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [ ] 5. Add navigation loop prevention mechanisms

  - Create navigation guard system to detect and prevent redirect loops
  - Add state tracking to compare previous and current authentication states
  - Implement debouncing or throttling for rapid navigation attempts
  - Add logging for navigation events to help debug issues
  - _Requirements: 3.5, 4.4_

- [x] 6. Implement comprehensive debug logging

  - ✅ Added detailed console logging for all auth state transitions
  - ✅ Added debug useEffect to track state change history
  - ✅ Existing logging for navigation events and decisions in \_layout.tsx
  - ✅ Console logging shows user status, loading states, and authentication status
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.5_

- [ ] 7. Add error boundary improvements for auth failures

  - Enhance error handling in `signIn` method to provide better error messages
  - Add proper error recovery mechanisms for storage failures
  - Implement graceful handling of network errors during auth operations
  - Add user-friendly error messages for common failure scenarios
  - _Requirements: 1.5, 4.5_

- [ ] 8. Create unit tests for state management

  - Write tests for consolidated loading state behavior
  - Test operation locking prevents concurrent login attempts
  - Test that `isInitialized` properly tracks auth check completion
  - Test error handling and recovery scenarios
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [ ] 9. Create integration tests for navigation behavior

  - Test that navigation only occurs when auth state actually changes
  - Test initial route determination based on authentication status
  - Test that navigation loops are prevented
  - Test app initialization flow with proper state transitions
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5_

- [ ] 10. Validate fix resolves page reloading issues
  - Test complete login flow to ensure no page reloads occur
  - Verify that rapid login attempts don't cause infinite re-renders
  - Test that navigation happens exactly once per auth state change
  - Confirm that loading states are properly managed throughout auth flows
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5_
